## Notes

### Breaking Changes in 2.0.2

#### CommonJS Import (Developer Experience Fix)

In version 2.0.1, CommonJS users had to use:

```javascript
const Routes = require('clear-router');
Router.default.get('/path', handler); // Awkward!
```

Now in 2.0.2, the natural syntax works:

```javascript
const Routes = require('clear-router');
Router.get('/path', handler); // Clean!
```

**Migration**: Simply remove `.default` from your CommonJS imports. Your code will be cleaner and more intuitive.

### Breaking Changes in 2.0.1

#### Express Version

- **Old**: Express 4.x
- **New**: Express 5.x (minimum 5.1.0)

Express 5 includes several breaking changes. Most notably:

- `res.json()` and `res.send()` now work asynchronously
- Error handling is more strict
- Some deprecated methods removed

**Migration**: Update your Express installation:

```bash
npm install express@^5.1.0
```

#### Node.js Version

- **Old**: Node.js 14.x or higher
- **New**: Node.js 22.0.0 or higher

**Migration**: Upgrade your Node.js version to 22 or higher.

#### No Other Breaking Changes

All routing APIs remain backward compatible. Your existing route definitions will work without modification.

### Deprecations

None at this time.

### Security

No known security issues. Please report any security vulnerabilities to oss@toneflix.net.

## Migration Guide

### From 2.0.1 to 2.0.2

This is a minor fix release that improves the CommonJS import experience.

#### If You Were Using `.default` in CommonJS

**Before (2.0.1):**

```javascript
const Routes = require('clear-router');
Router.default.get('/users', handler);
```

**After (2.0.2):**

```javascript
const Routes = require('clear-router');
Router.get('/users', handler); // Much better!
```

#### No Changes Needed for ESM or TypeScript

ESM and TypeScript imports continue to work exactly the same:

```javascript
// ESM - No changes
import Router from 'clear-router';
Router.get('/users', handler);
```

```typescript
// TypeScript - No changes
import Router from 'clear-router';
Router.get('/users', handler);
```

### From 1.x to 2.0.x

#### 1. Update Dependencies

```bash
npm install clear-router@latest express@^5.1.0
```

#### 2. Update Node.js

Ensure you're running Node.js 22.0.0 or higher:

```bash
node --version  # Should be v22.0.0 or higher
```

#### 3. Review Express 5 Changes

Check the [Express 5 migration guide](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/migrating-5.html) for any Express-specific changes that might affect your application.

#### 4. No Route Code Changes Needed

Your existing route definitions work without modification:

```javascript
// This still works exactly the same
Router.get('/users', ({ res }) => {
  res.json({ users: [] });
});

Router.group('/api', () => {
  Router.post('/data', handler);
});
```

### Module Format Examples

#### CommonJS (Default)

```javascript
const Routes = require('clear-router');

Router.get('/test', ({ res }) => {
  res.json({ message: 'CommonJS works!' });
});
```

#### ESM

```javascript
import Router from 'clear-router';

Router.get('/test', ({ res }) => {
  res.json({ message: 'ESM works!' });
});
```

#### TypeScript

```typescript
import Router from 'clear-router';
import type { HttpContext } from 'clear-router';

Router.get('/test', ({ res }: HttpContext) => {
  res.json({ message: 'TypeScript works!' });
});
```

### New Features in 2.0.x

#### Route Inspection (Added in 2.0.1)

```javascript
Router.get('/users', handler);
Router.post('/users', handler);

const routes = Router.allRoutes();
console.log(routes);
// [
//   {
//     methods: ['get'],
//     path: '/users',
//     middlewareCount: 0,
//     handlerType: 'function'
//   },
//   {
//     methods: ['post'],
//     path: '/users',
//     middlewareCount: 0,
//     handlerType: 'function'
//   }
// ]
```
